# Black Game Developers
A list of Black people who make games. Here they are. Hire them. Buy their stuff.

##Want to add someone to the list?
You can either:
- Fork this repo, make changes, and pull request (easiest for us)
- [Create a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/QuantumBox/blackgamedevs/issues) and include the person's name and website(s).
- Send a tweet to [@cattsmall](http://twitter.com/cattsmall), [@edibletoaster](http://twitter.com/edibletoaster), or [@chrisalgoo](http://twitter.com/chrisalgoo) (hardest for us + no guarantee we'll see it)
