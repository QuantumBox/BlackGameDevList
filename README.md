# Black Game Developers
A list of Black people who make games. Here they are. Hire them. Buy their stuff.

## Want to add someone to the list?
There are three ways to do so.

### The good way (quickest)

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `people.json` and/or `companies.json` depending on whether your submission is one person or a studio (both is also fine)
3. Duplicate the template at the top of the file(s) you are editing
4. Add and save your submission to the bottom of the list - Don't worry it all gets sorted
5. Create and submit a pull request for us to review

### The acceptable way
[Create a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/QuantumBox/blackgamedevs/issues) and include the person's name and website(s). We will get to it when we can.

### The hard way (slowest)
Send a tweet to [@cattsmall](http://twitter.com/cattsmall), [@edibletoaster](http://twitter.com/edibletoaster), or [@chrisalgoo](http://twitter.com/chrisalgoo). This is hardest for us. There is no guarantee we'll see your request.
